# Blender Building Generator Requirements
#
# Note: This project runs inside Blender's Python environment.
# The 'bpy' module is provided by Blender and cannot be installed via pip.
#
# To run the scripts:
#   1. Open Blender
#   2. Go to Scripting workspace
#   3. Run: from scripts import main; main()
#
# Or via command line:
#   blender --background --python -c "from scripts import main; main()"

# No external pip packages required - only Blender's built-in bpy module
# and Python standard library (os, math, random) are used.
